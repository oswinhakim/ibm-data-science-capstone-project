# ibm-data-science-capstone-project

I will apply my data science skills as a Data scientist for a private space launch company in this project.    

As a starting point of almost all data science projects, I need to collect data, as much and relevant as possible.

I will be collecting data from various sources. After my raw data has been collected, I will need to improve the quality by performing data wrangling. 

Then I can start exploring the processed data. I will explore some really interesting real-world datasets. I'll get to practice my SQL skills as I query the data and gather insights.  

I'll gain further insights into the data by applying some basic statistical analysis and data visualization, I'll be able to see directly how variables might be related to each other.   

I'll drill down into finer levels of detail by splitting the data into groups defined by categorical variables or factors in my data.  

I will build, evaluate, and refine predictive models for discovering more exciting insights. 

The final task of this capstone project is to create a presentation that will be developed into stories of all my analysis.
